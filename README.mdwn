# Software Dependency Visualizer PROTOTYPE

**This tool is incomplete and unusable.**.

This prototype tool is the result of an investigation into visualising software
dependencies.

Rough aims of the tool:

* Interactively browse components and dependencies
* Support huge datasets (for example, an entire Debian release)
* Zoom between package or repository groupings, to individual files

## Implementation

This prototype is implemented as a web application, and uses:

* [Neo4j graph database](http://neo4j.com/) for storage
* A minimal Python server to serve code and wrap the database
* [D3.js](https://d3js.org/) to render the results as interactive SVG graphics

A minimal server process is supplied. We need to have some kind of custom
server-side code in order to wrap the database; it's not easy for the
browser to talk directly to a Neo4j instance due to the same-origin
security policy. The server process is written in Python currently. This
is just because it allowed me to complete the prototype quickly. The
server could be reimplemented in another language fairly easily.
