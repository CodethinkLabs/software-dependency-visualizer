# Software Dependency Visualizer PROTOTYPE

**This tool is incomplete and unusable.**.

This prototype tool is the result of an investigation into visualising software
dependencies.

Rough aims of the tool:

* Interactively browse components and dependencies
* Support huge datasets (for example, an entire Debian release)
* Zoom between package or repository groupings, to individual files

## Implementation

This prototype is implemented as a web application, and uses:

* [Neo4j graph database](http://neo4j.com/) for storage
* A minimal Python server to serve code and wrap the database
* [D3.js](https://d3js.org/) to render the results as interactive SVG graphics

A minimal server process is supplied. We need to have some kind of custom
server-side code in order to wrap the database; it's not easy for the
browser to talk directly to a Neo4j instance due to the same-origin
security policy. The server process is written in Python currently. This
is just because it allowed me to complete the prototype quickly. The
server could be reimplemented in another language fairly easily.

## Running the demo

* Start neo4j. If you've downloaded a copy of the neo4j community edition from http://neo4j.com/download/, then
change to the unpacked directory and run:

    neo4j-community-2.3.2/bin/neo4j
    
* server.py and the 'neo4j' import tool are hardcoded for password ```insecure``` so you'll need to set neo4j's
  password to that, or modify both the tools. You'll be asked to change it when you connect to neo4j on
  http://localhost:7474.

* You'll need a copy of context.jsonld which can be served over http. There is one in the http directory. You can
  start a simple http server using

    cd http
    python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000

  Or use another service like ```mini-httpd```.

* If this is the first time you've run it, import that data from the examples directory:

    import/neo4j examples/shared-lib.yaml

* Start 'server.py' from this repository. You may need to specifically invoke it with Python 3, so use 'python3 server.py'.
Once this has started, you can point a browser at http://localhost:8080 to see the rendered results.

## Setup for MacOS

```
brew install python3
sudo python3 -m pip install pyyaml neo4jrestclient bottle py2neo pyld
```
