Visualisations of software dependencies

The majority of code runs browser-side and is written in Javascript.

A minimal server process is supplied. We need to have some kind of custom
server-side code in order to wrap the database; it's not easy for the
browser to talk directly to a Neo4j instance due to the same-origin
security policy. The server process is written in Python currently. This
is just because it allowed me to complete the prototype quickly. The
server could be reimplemented in another language fairly easily.

These need to be interactive to be useful ...

# Prior art

debtree: <https://collab-maint.alioth.debian.org/debtree/>

  * Generates dependency graphs for Debian packages using Graphviz

# Javascript graph visualisation

GraphDracula: <http://www.graphdracula.net/>

  * Looks simple and cool, also has links to various related projects

InfoViz: <https://philogb.github.io/jit/>

  * Can generate zoomable, draggable graphs, e.g.:

Canviz:

  * Basically dumps graphviz output to an HTML canvas:
