These need to be interactive to be useful ...

# Prior art

debtree: <https://collab-maint.alioth.debian.org/debtree/>

  * Generates dependency graphs for Debian packages using Graphviz

# Javascript graph visualisation

GraphDracula: <http://www.graphdracula.net/>

  * Looks simple and cool, also has links to various related projects

InfoViz: <https://philogb.github.io/jit/>

  * Can generate zoomable, draggable graphs, e.g.:
    <https://philogb.github.io/jit/static/v20/Jit/Examples/ForceDirected/example2.html>

Canviz:

  * Basically dumps graphviz output to an HTML canvas:
